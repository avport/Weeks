distributed - 

structure 
directory
	index.html
	CSS foleder with style sheets
	JS with folders
	views with html

semantic tags help with google rating

pseudo class
.box: first-child: blue;
selector is box, pheudo selector is first-child

li: first-letter {
	font-size: 150%; 
}

rems and percentages are best, better than em and pixels




Positioning 
put absolute inside relative containers - the stuff moved will move relative to container

static- can't apply offset 

relative inside relative - moves based on parent

absolute applied to static or relative pulls items from flow 
-applying offset will move the absolute item in a static container will move it relative to viewport
-applying offset will move absolute item inside absolute container relative to the container

fixed - will be offset relative to container they were in 


Lab1
nav bar (logo and ul)
middle 
use floats and clear margin 0 auto 


transform: translateX(-50%);



justify-content main axis
align-items cross axis
display: flex; 


Media queries - after the screen is at least 480 px these are the changes that happen 
@media only screen and (min-width: 480px){
	.title{
	font-size: 24px; 
	}
	.generic-text{
	font-size: 18px; 
	}
}
